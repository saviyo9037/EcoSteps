    <h2>What is Waste Management?</h2>
    <p>
        Waste management refers to the processes involved in managing waste from cradle to grave. This includes the collection, transportation, disposal/recycling, and monitoring of waste materials produced as a result of human activity.
    </p>
    <p>
        Waste management encompasses all types of waste, such as household, industrial, and hazardous. Waste can also be solid, liquid, or gas, each of which has its own methods of management and disposal.
    </p>
    <p>
        The whole purpose of waste management is to reduce the amount of waste that goes into landfill. Instead, rubbish should be seen as a valuable resource.
    </p>

    <h2>Statistics Related to Waste Management in India </h2>
    <p>India produces 62 million tonnes of waste per year, and out of this, only 70% are collected. Surveys have revealed that only 12 million tonnes of these wastes are treated, while 31 million tonnes of waste are being used in landfills. </p>
    <p>The overall generation of municipal solid waste is estimated to increase to 165 million tonnes by 2030 due to the changing patterns of consumption and also rapid growth in the economy.</p>

   <h2>The Rise of Holistic Waste Management Practices</h2>

   <img src="page4_images/approach.png">
   <p>Waste management today is a complex topic, and the operational practices of transporting and processing waste differ widely between cities, nations and across continents.</p>

<p>However, efforts have been made to dissect the problem and build a framework that divides the broad types of waste management into a hierarchical system. This system endeavors to cover the entire lifecycle of a product and extract the maximum potential benefits from any waste.</p>

<p>As a result, types of waste management are usually split into three categories based upon the now famous “3Rs” — Reduce, Reuse, Recycle. Unfortunately, however, this concept only targets best practice waste management systems by offering guidance on the ideal ways in which waste can be repurposed for minimal impact on the environment. In reality, there are waste materials that cannot be processed using this program, and for certain waste products, an impasse is all too often reached. With these issues in mind, the waste management hierarchy can be extended to include the following concepts.</p>

The waste management hierarchy is a strategic framework designed to guide sustainable waste practices, ranking them from most to least preferred. Each step plays a crucial role in reducing the environmental impact of waste and promoting efficient resource use.

<h3>Prevention</h3>
<p>Prevention is the most preferred option in waste management. It aims to stop waste from being created in the first place. This involves designing products and systems in a way that reduces material use, increases efficiency, and eliminates unnecessary packaging. For example, choosing digital documents over printed ones, avoiding single-use plastics, or buying long-lasting, quality items instead of disposable alternatives are all preventive actions. When waste is not created, there’s no need to manage it — making prevention the most sustainable choice.
</p>
<h3>Minimisation</h3>
<p>When prevention is not entirely possible, the next best step is minimisation. This means reducing the amount or toxicity of waste generated. It involves making informed decisions that reduce excess material use during production and consumption. An example of minimisation is purchasing products in bulk to avoid small packaging, using concentrated cleaning products to reduce container waste, or opting for materials that are biodegradable or less hazardous. This step helps lower the volume of waste needing further treatment.
</p>
<h3> Reuse</h3>
<p>Reusing means extending the life of products by using them multiple times before discarding. It emphasizes creativity and resourcefulness in keeping items in circulation for as long as possible. For example, glass jars can be reused for storage, old clothes can be repurposed into cleaning rags, and worn-out furniture can be refurbished instead of thrown away. Reuse reduces the demand for new products, conserves raw materials, and prevents items from ending up in landfills.
</p>
<h3>Recycling</h3>
<p>Recycling involves processing waste materials to make new products, thereby diverting them from landfills. Common recyclable materials include paper, plastic, glass, and metals. For instance, used paper can be turned into recycled notebooks, plastic bottles can become synthetic fabrics, and scrap metal can be melted down to produce new tools. While recycling is beneficial, it still consumes energy and requires sorting and cleaning of materials. It is a good practice, but not as efficient as prevention or reuse.
</p>
<h3>Energy Recovery</h3>
<p>If waste cannot be reused or recycled, energy recovery is the next option. This process extracts usable energy from waste through methods like incineration, gasification, or anaerobic digestion. For example, organic food waste can be broken down to produce biogas, while non-recyclable plastics can be burned in waste-to-energy plants to generate electricity. While it reduces waste volume and recovers some value, it can also produce emissions and should be used cautiously.
</p>
<h3>Disposal</h3>
<p>Disposal is the least preferred option in the hierarchy and is only considered when all other options are not feasible. It includes methods such as landfilling and incineration without energy recovery. Disposal has significant negative environmental impacts, including soil and water pollution, methane emissions, and long-term land use. For this reason, sustainable waste systems strive to minimize disposal and prioritize the higher steps of the hierarchy.
